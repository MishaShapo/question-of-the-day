# Misha's Question of the Day

My personal project for getting to grips with creating web apps using Meteor

Live site (may not be most current commit) : [mishasqofd.meteor.com](mishasqofd.meteor.com)<br>

##Goal
I am building this simple app to gain experience as a web developer. Using GitHub to track my progress is a good way to manage versions and share my code with others. Once I am finished making the app, I hope to release some tutorials on YouTube (but that might be a *while*) :smile:

##Features
 - A new trivia question every day!
 - Personal profile with gorgeous graphs and statistics to monitor your progress!
 - Suggest a question and you might get featured on the home page!
 - View public leaderboards to see who's got the brains!
 - Simple and intuitive material design styling!
 
 
##TODO
- [ ] Create schmeas for `users` and for `questions`
- [ ] Properly validate user input
  - [ ] receive validation through console
  - [ ] add GUI for validation. If user not logged in, offer `Save Answer` which redirects to login/signup GUI
- [ ] Add user roles so that admins can add question without authentication and users can suggest a question
- [ ] Create proper leaderboards
- [ ] Create My Profile page with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) graphs
- [ ] Create Badge system for answering questions
- [ ] Create public API for accessing statistics (also figure out legal problems. Let's not have another Facebook)
- [ ] Publish YouTube tutorials

##Contributing
I am always open to suggestions. Submit a feature-request and I will gladly look at it. Also, if you are a Meteor guru, I would love to hear what you have to say. I've completed the [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope) project from the [Discover Meteor Book](https://www.discovermeteor.com/) , but I am still kind-of a noob. :smirk:
